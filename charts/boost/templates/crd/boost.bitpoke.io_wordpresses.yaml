                            built in to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those
                            available to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.

                    Condition is a reimplementation of the Kubernetes condition type.
                    We need this instead of metav1.Condition because we need to set some fields as optional.
